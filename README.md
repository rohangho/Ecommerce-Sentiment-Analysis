# Ecommerce Sentiment Analysis

This project is dedicated to performing sentiment analysis on E-commerce data.

## Project Structure

- `Ecommerce/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
  - `train_data.csv`: Data for training the sentiment analysis model.
  - `test_data.csv`: Data for testing and validation.
  - `test_data_hidden.csv`: Hidden test set for final evaluation.

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain code integrity and ensure a stable production environment, all contributors must follow these rules:

### 1. Branching Policy
- **No Direct Pushes to Main:** Nobody is allowed to push code directly to the `main` branch.
- **Feature Branches:** Always create a new branch for your changes. 
  - Naming convention: `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`.
- **Pull Requests:** Raise a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch. 

### 2. Review Process
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved before merging into the `main` branch.
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting a review.

### 3. Issue Reporting
- **Report Bugs:** If you find any issues or bugs in the `main` code, do not attempt a quick fix on `main`. 
- **Raise an Issue Request:** Create a formal issue request in the repository describing the bug, steps to reproduce it, and the expected behavior.
